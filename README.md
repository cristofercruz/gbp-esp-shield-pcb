Enthusiasts on the [Game Boy Camera Club discord server](http://bit.ly/gbccd) have been working on a Game Boy Printer emulator project based on ESP8266 D1 mini boards. Taking inspiration from other projects like the [Gameboy Link Cable Breakout PCB](https://github.com/Palmr/gb-link-cable), I created this shield board to add a link connector and pinouts for an oled screen.

The board is designed with two options for the oled screen placement. There are mousebite perferations to trim the board if you plan on using the smaller layout only.

Here's a render of the PCB:

# Components

Besides the OLED and ESP8266 board, there are two components this PCB uses:

* 1x 4.7 Kâ„¦ resistor, required
* 1x 3.5 mm LED, optional


Placements for the components are clearly marked on the board's silkscreen. Find the resistor on the bottom of the PCB.

# Configuration

The shield PCB breaks out appropriate pins to the OLED and the printer port. When using the [wifi-gbp-emulator](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator) project, include this in your `config.h` file:

```
// GBPrinter shield PCB
// Pinout to OLED
#define USE_OLED
#define OLED_SDA 4
#define OLED_SCL 5
// Pinout to link port
#define SENSE_BOOT_MODE
#define GB_5V_OUT 15
```

You will be able to use the attached OLED, as well as toggle the board to printer mode simply by attaching the link cable to the shield.

When connecting a link cable to the shield, check the silkscreen for indicators on which side should be placed up. (The flat side of the connector should face down and the rounded side should face up, the same side as the OLED screen.)
