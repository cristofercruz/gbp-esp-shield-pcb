Enthusiasts on the [Game Boy Camera Club discord server](http://bit.ly/gbccd) have been working on a Game Boy Printer emulator project based on ESP8266 D1 mini boards. Taking inspiration from other projects like the [Gameboy Link Cable Breakout PCB](https://github.com/Palmr/gb-link-cable), I created this shield board to add a link connector and pinouts for an oled screen.

The board is designed with two options for the oled screen placement. There are mousebite perferations to trim the board if you plan on using the smaller layout only.

Here's a render of the PCB:

# Components

Besides the OLED and ESP8266 board, there are two components this PCB uses:

* 1x 4.7 Kâ„¦ resistor, required
* 1x 3.5 mm LED, optional


Placements for the components are clearly marked on the board's silkscreen. Find the resistor on the bottom of the PCB.

# Pinouts

The PCB breaks out these pins to the OLED:

* SDA - D2
* SDL - D1

When using the [wifi-gbp-emulator](https://github.com/HerrZatacke/wifi-gbp-emulator) project, include this in your `config.h` file:

```
// Uncomment if using an adafruit oled display
#define USE_OLED
// Alternative OLED Pins
#define OLED_SDA 4
#define OLED_SCL 5
```

Note that 4 and 5 are the Arduino digital pin numbers corresponding to the D1 board's pins labeled D2 and D1. [Pin Reference](https://escapequotes.net/esp8266-wemos-d1-mini-pins-and-diagram/)
